Each file shows how the data was transformed as I worked on it. 

**Raw Data** - this contains the raw data file as well as the Problem statement or request needed for this data.

**Data Cleaning** - the raw data is now fully organized, which can aid me in practical data analysis. 

**Data Exploration and Analysis** - this shows how I have explored the data, created some pivot tables, and made notes of my discovery. You may notice that it's not super organized because the end product will be shown on the following file. 

**Data Presentation** - this shows my key findings and my data visualization.
